      <p>Using voice commands has become pretty ubiquitous nowadays, as <strong>more mobile phone users use voice assistants</strong> such as Siri and Cortana, and as devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have been invading our living rooms.</p>

      <p>The world around us is full of little things and experiences that shape us, our way of thinking, but also how we tackle our work. Influenced by these encounters, <strong>every designer develops their unique style and workflow</strong>, and studying their artwork — the compositions, geometry of lines and shapes, light and shadows, the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/inspiring-illustrations-bright-colors-cool-patterns/">colors and patterns</a> — can all inspire us to look beyond our own horizon and try something new.</p>

      <p>If you're like me, then being persuaded requires a scientific approach and concrete examples. And that's exactly what this article does. It explains how gamification can work by showing the relationship between gamification, UX design and BJ Fogg's modern persuasion phenomenon, "mass interpersonal persuasion." And it has a lot of practical gamification examples that you can <strong>apply to your own products for more engaging experiences</strong>.</p>

      <p>Today, virtually all companies (except for special ones like Basecamp) have to grow non-stop. Why? Well, that's simply how the capitalist engine works. Investors pour money into startups, banks loan money to entrepreneurs, employees accept stock options instead of cash, all in the hope of the company growing much bigger.</p>

      </h2>

      <p>In its move to patch a security hole as part of the iOS 10.3 release, Apple has introduced (yet) another redirection mechanism that developers must handle when attempting to <strong>implement mobile deep-link routing</strong> (i.e. the mechanism to route users to a specific page inside a mobile app, rather than the App Store or app home page).</p>

      <p>This redirection instance has introduced additional friction to the app download and reopening process, and data shows that it has decreased conversion rates on iOS 10.3. This post examines the issue in detail and discusses solutions to help developers fix it.</p>

      <p>Component-based libraries or frameworks such as Vue have given us the wonderful ability to create <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/writing-next-generation-reusable-javascript-modules/">reusable components</a> to be spread throughout their respective application, ensuring that they are consistent, and (hopefully) simplifying how they are used.</p>

      <p>In particular, form inputs tend to have plenty of complexity that you'd want to hide in a component, such as custom designs, labels, validation, help messages, and making sure each of these pieces are in the correct order so that they render correctly.</p>

      <p>I have been working on the web for over 22 years now, and I feel like I wasted so many of those years. If only I could go back and share a few hard truths with myself at the start of my career. Unfortunately, I cannot, but I can share that advice with you.</p>
